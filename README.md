Lifeskills Learning 4 Kids
This website is for a children's tutoring company, with a focus on teaching lifeskills.
With such an increasing focus on exams and academics in schools (starting as early as Nursery for many), children
are missing out on those essential day to day skills to get them through life.  E.g, following a set of instructions to 
make a piece of IKEA furnitiure or how to follow a recipe.  We teach them to complete daily activities by UNDERSTANDING what needs to be done, 
PROBLEM SOLVING through a range of strategies and drawing upon experiences and THINKING skills.  
The company website is designed to give an insight into its aims, principles behind its approach and give some examples
of daily lifeskills within each of the aforementioned areas in an accessible and inviting way.

UX

This website is for the owners of the company with a strong focus on providing information and insight for the user.
The website is designed for the user to understand what the purpose of the company is, who and how it works and what it does.


----------------"USER STORIES".  for use of website and form and purpose


As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
The website can be divided into 4 main areas, each containing a variable amount of pages.  These are:

Introduction Page (index)
About Approach and Awards pages (navigated by header and footer menus)
Understanding Problem Solving and Thinking Pages (navigated by color associated columns present on each page)
Contact page (navigated through footer via menu link)

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
