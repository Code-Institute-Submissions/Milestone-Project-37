Lifeskills Learning 4 Kids
This website is for a children's tutoring company, with a focus on teaching lifeskills.
With such an increasing focus on exams and academics in schools (starting as early as Nursery for many), children
are missing out on those essential day to day skills to get them through life.  E.g, following a set of instructions to 
make a piece of IKEA furnitiure or how to follow a recipe.  We teach them to complete daily activities by UNDERSTANDING what needs to be done, 
PROBLEM SOLVING through a range of strategies and drawing upon experiences and THINKING skills.  
The company website is designed to give an insight into its aims, principles behind its approach and give some examples
of daily lifeskills within each of the aforementioned areas in an accessible and inviting way.

UX

This website is for the owners of the company with a strong focus on providing information and insight for the user.
The website is designed for the user to understand what the purpose of the company is, who and how it works and what it does.

In a test of the website, users (from SLACK Code Institute Peer-review channel and professionals within my school workplace) found the site to be clean, clear and easy to navigate.  
When tested through W3 validator, Goolge Mobile Friendly-Test, W3 CSS validator and W3 HTML Validator only one error appeared.

W3 HTML validator:
            Illegal character ('|') in google font Stylesheet.

This however did not demonstrate any issues with the website's UX.

The website can be divided into 4 main areas, each containing a variable amount of pages.  These are:

Introduction Page (index)
About Approach and Awards pages (navigated by header and footer menus)
Understanding Problem Solving and Thinking Pages (navigated by color associated columns present on each page)
Contact page (navigated through footer via menu link)

The website uses Bootstrap 4.4.1 due to its layout and responsiveness.  Custom alterations are made
in order to increase customisation of website e.g, color schemes and spacing.
