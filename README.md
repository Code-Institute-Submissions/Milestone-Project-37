# Lifeskills Learning 4 Kids

This website is for a children's tutoring company, with a focus on teaching lifeskills.
Having worked in Special Education for close to 10 years, the lack of focus on lifeskills both in and out of a school setting was of great concern to many families.  
As students have various needs, having a structured, research backed approach to teaching lifeskills was considered a need outside of a school environment, just as Maths and English tutoring centers are.

With such an increasing focus on exams and academics in schools (starting as early as Nursery for many), children
are missing out on those essential day to day skills to get them through life.  E.g, following a set of instructions to 
make a piece of IKEA furnitiure or how to follow a recipe.  We teach them to complete daily activities by UNDERSTANDING what needs to be done, 
PROBLEM SOLVING through a range of strategies and drawing upon experiences and THINKING skills.  
The company website is designed to give an insight into its aims, principles behind its approach and give some examples
of daily lifeskills within each of the aforementioned areas in an accessible and inviting way.

## UX

This website is for the owners of the company with a strong focus on providing information and insight for the user.
The website is designed for the user to understand what the purpose of the company is, who and how it works and what it does.

The website can be divided into 4 main areas, each containing a variable amount of pages.  These are:

* Introduction Page (index)
* About Approach and Awards pages (navigated by header and footer menus)
* Understanding Problem Solving and Thinking Pages (navigated by color associated columns present on each page)
* Contact page (navigated through footer via menu link)


## Features

The website uses Bootstrap 4.4.1 due to its layout and responsiveness.  Custom alterations are made
in order to increase customisation of website e.g, color schemes and spacing. 

The following features are also included throughout the page (external sources attributed).

* Navbar (Bootstrap 4.4.1, Font Awesome and Google Fonts)
Navbar includes company name styled with 2 different fonts for impact and to emphasise appeal to children.  Bootstrap 4 was used
to set layout. Navbar links hover red.

* Content (Font Awesome)
Font Awesome icons are used throughout the page.  Various icons are coloured/re-sized using CSS.

* Background images via CSS
Images are styled using CSS and written as background images.  As images are non-essential
and do not contain any information, this is why this was done as opposed to using a HTML tag.

* Footer (Bootstrap 4.4.1 and Font Awesome)
Footer includes contact page link and repeats menu options from Navbar for UX ease.  
Home button is stylised through Font Awesome.

* Form (Bootstrap 4.4.1)
On the contact page, the form is used to collect user contact info.  Form submission is currently
empty.


## Features Left to Implement

* Games in content areas
In discussion with Users who tested the site, having some interactive games to alternate between
quizzes would be a good way to increase UX.

* Live form submission:  The contact details form is currently empty and can be added to submit through relevant tool.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4.4.1
4. Font Awesome
5. Google fonts
6. Procreate (app for visuals)

## Testing

The website was tested using the following:

* Google Dev. Tools 
This was used to view the responsiveness of the webpage through the following:
Pixel 2, Pixel XL, iphone 5, SE, 6/7/8 and plus versions, X and ipad and ipad pro.  

The website link was also tested on a Macbook Pro.

* Validation tools

The website was checked through the following validation services:

* https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsamc85.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1%2Findex.html
(1 error relating to google font link- bad value).  

* https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator (no errors)

* https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=ItaRQsvKUbcrc-COLZeDDg (no errors)


Overall the website was deemed to be mobile friendly and adhered to HTML and CSS standards.


## User bugs

In initial testing some text would overflow in columns.  Certain icon layouts would also 'bunch' together
and were corrected.  


## Deployment
All code was written on Github.  Files were added, commited and pushed to Github Repository for this user.  
This was repeated throughout the writing of the code.
The page was published using Github Pages, accessed in the settings part of the repository.
Commit history is viewable through the Repository 

https://github.com/samc85/Milestone-Project-1 

(note: commit history for style.css is also captured within 
style/csscommithistory/ where screenshots were taken.  This is due to history not replicating during 
file and folder re-naming).
